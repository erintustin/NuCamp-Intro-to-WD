    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>I firmly believe that <strong>anyone</strong> can learn <em>anything, anytime</em>. 
    I have been playing guitar for years but never thought I would play drums. 
    My partner is a drummer and never thought he could play guitar. 
    In the past year and a half I've taught myself to play drums with his help, and I have helped him learn guitar. 
    </p>
    <p>The audio I'm sharing is us playing each other's instruments. We're not yet GREAT, 
    but we continue to learn from and grow in knowledge together. 
    I wish the same for all of us learning to code in this class together!
